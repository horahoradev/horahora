later:

- nginx as reverse proxy for everything
- things like youtube support (although honestly, let's just make it so we can feed arbitrary links to youtube-dl for processing)
  so we're not restricted to very specific types of archive requests
- something more proper for the frontend since im a sucker for webapps and not server side rendered pages
- retry failed downloads of scheduled videos

now:

- userservice

================================================================================

- scheduler: depends on python3, youtube-dl (the fork, probably) in PATH
- scheduler/downloader: calls python3 directly with path to youtube-dl...
  since its calling __main__, we can just replace it with the youtube-dl in PATH?
- scheduler: needs redis for redlock

- video_service: depends on ffmpeg in PATH
- video_service: remove dependency on redis
  absolutely nothing in the code makes use of it, we don't need it
- video_service: remove tracing stuff (jaeger)
- video_service: untangle backblaze storage stuff (hint: OriginFQDN)
- video_service: remove need for backblaze config, create a new local-only `storage`
  determine how this thing uses the stored stuff (how does it retrieve it?)
  looks like it stores the "manifest" file, the .mpd with the OriginFQDN, which we
  can mangle how we want for the time being (although this, without a doubt, will be annoying)
- video_service: modify uploadDir (or maybe not, it doesnt matter too much)

- frontend/config: remove tracing stuff (jaeger)
- frontend/main: figure out what nginx:86 is supposed to serve
  apparently that's just test data? we can probably safely remove this, nothing else references this

  ...except video_service, that thing uploads to test_files directory on upload

================================================================================

frontend:
  configures via env, we need to provide:
  - UserServiceGRPCAddress
  - VideoServiceGRPCAddress
  - SchedulerServiceGRPCAddress

user_service:
  configures via env, we need to provide:
  - pgs_host (postgres)
  - pgs_port
  - pgs_user
  - pgs_pass
  - pgs_db
  - GRPCPort
